        A page is considered to be present if it has non-default content and the
        "Delete this box in order to be evaluated for this medal criterion" box
        has been removed for pages that have that.

        Enter your team name (e.g UNSW_Australia), year and any awards you
        intend to contest. If an award is not listed, it does not have a
        required url. A common reason a required url may not work is if the name is not spelt or capitalised correctly.
