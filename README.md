# WikiMate
## UNSW iGEM 2020

Web tool for checking if your wiki has the required urls for the medals and awards you intend to contest. Integrated on our wiki at https://2020.igem.org/Team:UNSW_Australia/Software

### Testing Locally

run
`chromium --disable-web-security --user-data-dir=/tmp/chromeprofile index.html`

this will work with chrome or chromium and possbily other chrome-based browsers. There doesn't seem to be an equivalent thing in Firefox.
